      Once upon a time in the kingdom of JavaScript, there lived a coder named
      Bob. Bob was on a quest to conquer the mighty
      <a href="https://www.google.com/">Bug Mountain</a>, where bugs of all
      shapes and sizes dwelled.

      Armed with his keyboard and a mug of coffee, Bob bravely faced syntax
      monsters and wrestled with the elusive null dragons. But his greatest
      nemesis was the mighty
      <a href="https://www.google.com/">Bug Queen</a>, who hid in the deep
      dungeons of the codebase.

      With a clever strategy and a sprinkle of humor, Bob defeated the Bug Queen
      and emerged victorious. The kingdom celebrated with joyous console logs,
      and Bob became a legendary coder known for his wit and coding prowess.
