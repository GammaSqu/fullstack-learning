      //CLASSES
      //templates for creating objects
      //they ENCLOSE in data with code to work on that data?
      //What consists in CLAsses are:

      //Constructor
      //called when we create a new class instance
      //This
      //using the keyword to access the class property or function
      //#[Name] - hastag name
      //to create private property or private function
      //new ClassName(...)
      //to create a new instance

      //For this exercise, we're building a simple app Counter that will be inside <div id="app">
      //we will be using classes to build it

      class Counter {
        #container;
        //the general form of the result?
        #decreaseButton;
        //will affect the decrease button
        #increaseButton;
        //will affect the increase button
        #input;
        //the result number when using the buttons

        constructor(container) {
          this.#container = container;
          this.#render();
          //place the function into the constructor (main container)
        }

        //Noe we add in a render function
        //This structure is slightly different to how I normally attempt to code it

        #render() {
          this.#container.innerHTML = `
      <button data-component="decrease">-</button>
      <input type="number" value="0" />
      <button data-component="increase">+</button>`;

          //now we code for the rest:
          //INPUT
          this.#input = this.#container.querySelector('input');
          //for this context, this is the same as using document.querySelector

          //DECREASE BUTTON
          this.#decreaseButton = this.#container.querySelector(
            '[data-component="decrease"]'
          );

          //now we will add a click event to the decrease button
          this.#decreaseButton.addEventListener(
            'click',
            this.#decrease.bind(this)
          );

          //INCREASE BUTTON
          this.#increaseButton = this.#container.querySelector(
            '[data-component="increase"]'
          );
          this.#increaseButton.addEventListener(
            'click',
            this.#increase.bind(this)
          );
        }
        //we've made the function, so taht means nothing has happened so far
        //becuase now it's time to apply the function within the code (ABOVE)

        //we've also added the functions of #decrease and #increase
        //so now we will define them
        #decrease() {
          //we will let the value = to input value as we also convert it to a number
          let value = Number(this.#input.value);
          //because it's decrease button, the new value will be -1 of current value
          let newValue = value - 1;

          this.#input.value = newValue;
        }
        //increase would be similar to decrease
        #increase() {
          let value = Number(this.#input.value);
          let newValue = value + 1;

          this.#input.value = newValue;
        }

        //Now if we attempt to use the buttons now
        //you will find it will not work
        //The reason is because of 'this.#decreaseButton.addEventListener('click', this.#decrease)'
        //Similar to the this.html, the THIS in this context is the button but not the decrease/increase function
        //the button has nothing to extract
        //so in this case, we will need to use .bind
        //i.e 'this.#decreaseButton.addEventListener('click', this.#decrease.bind(this))' - adding .bind(this)

        //Not sure what this is
        //Adding a Public Print Value - NOTE THAT IT DOESNT HAVE #
        //Making this public NOT PRIVATE
        printValue() {
          let value = Number(this.#input.value);

          console.log(value);
        }

        //With this
        //if you were to type counterApp.printValue() into the console
        //You can see the result of value in console
        //However, if you use #increase/decrease functions ('counterApp.#increase()')
        //The result won't be shown in console, but still applies in website input

        //I'm guessing this is just to show us that public function has the risk of being hacked
        //If someone knows how to operate the function in code with debug
        //Then they have the power to change and affect the site
      }

      let counterApp = new Counter(document.querySelector('#app'));
